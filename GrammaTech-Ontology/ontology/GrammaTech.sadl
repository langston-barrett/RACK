/* ACERT requirements have confidence parameters on text extraction */
AcertRequirement is a type of REQUIREMENT.
    textConfidence (note "confidence that this was requirement text")
        describes AcertRequirement with values of type double.
    ifTextConfidence (note "confidence that this was the if-portion of the text")
        describes AcertRequirement with values of type double.
    thenTextConfidence (note "confidence that this was the then-portion of the text")
        describes AcertRequirement with values of type double.
    givenTextConfidence (note "confidence that this was the given-portion of the text")
        describes AcertRequirement with values of type double.

AcertTestResult is a type of TEST_RESULT.
    failureReason (note "reason for failure, e.g.: timeout, crash, bad output")
        describes AcertTestResult with values of type FailureReason.

	failureDetails (note "Additional detail describing the failure reason")
	    describes AcertTestResult with values of type string.

    /* Metrics */
    cpuTime (note "seconds of CPU time used when executing the test execution")
        describes TEST_EXECUTION with values of type double.

    memory (note "maximum bytes of resident memory used by test execution")
        describes TEST_EXECUTION with values of type double.

FailureReason (note "High-level reasons for ACERT test result failure")

    must be one of {Timeout, Crash, DifferentOutput, Assert}.
Timeout         is a FailureReason with identifier "Timeout".
Crash           is a FailureReason with identifier "Crash".
DifferentOutput is a FailureReason with identifier "DifferentOutput".
Assert          is a FailureReason with identifier "Assert".
